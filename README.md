# 🔐 Security & Accessibility System Dashboard

This Streamlit dashboard showcases my senior design project—a hardware-based security and accessibility system integrating custom circuits, PCB layouts, and mechanical CAD. It also includes fundamental LTspice circuits to demonstrate core electronics understanding.

## 🚀 Features

- 🛠️ CAD models of kickbutton user interface  
- 🧩 PCB + KiCad designs for full system integration  
- 📘 LTspice-based fundamental circuits with technical insights  
- 📱 Simple dropdown UI for interactive exploration  

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.  
✅ During installation, **check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"** (or manually add Python to your environment variables after install).

Then open a terminal or PowerShell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScottTorzewski/Senior-Project.git
cd Senior-Project
pip install streamlit
streamlit run project_dashboard_app.py
