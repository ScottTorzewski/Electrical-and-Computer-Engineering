## 1Ô∏è‚É£ SALE (Smart Assisted Living Environment): Integrated IoT Solutions for Individuals with Limited Limb Mobility
With the growing need for independent living among people with disabilities and the elderly, smart homes offer a transformative solution through automation and remote control of daily household tasks. However, most existing systems lack inclusive designs that address the specific needs of users with impaired motor function. To bridge this gap, we developed a minimalist yet scalable smart home frame-work incorporating a custom adaptive remote control device that uses directional input to interact with various smart appliances. The system enables users to perform essential and semi-essential tasks such as lighting, entertainment, and door control, with minimal physical effort. My contributions include the remote control device interaction system and the smart security system.

### üÖ∞Ô∏è Remote Control Device Interaction System
The SALE-R (SALE Remote) buttons are designed to offer directional control to the resident, allowing them to navigate the smart home interface using up, down, left, right, and select commands. These buttons serve both assistive and rehabilitative purposes. While they enable the user to control the entire smart home system through the Smart Mobile Device, they also promote the use of residual limb mobility. Each time a button is physically pressed, the corresponding UI button in the bottom window of the Smart Mobile Device app lights up green. The primary circuitry of the system consists of a printed circuit board that detects button press signals, processes them, and sends them to the Smart Mobile Device using Bluetooth Low Energy (through the Pico W). The kick buttons were custom-designed and 3-D printed using Fusion360.

The core component is a transmissive photomicrosensor. Each button is equipped with one of these optical sensors, and the button mount includes a spring mechanism. When the button is pressed, an internal flag interrupts the laser beam inside the optical switch. This interruption signals the sensor that the button has been activated, thereby registering a button press.

### üí° Optoelectronics

The EE-SX3173/4173-P series photomicrosensor achieves high precision and reliability by integrating an infrared LED emitter and a photo-integrated circuit (photo IC) in a single housing. The key to its advanced performance is the photo IC, which incorporates sophisticated signal processing directly on the detector chip rather than just relying on a simple phototransistor. The sensor uses a near-infrared LED, typically with a peak wavelength around 940 nm. Infrared light is less affected by ambient visible light, a common source of interference. A focusing lens is molded into the emitter side of the housing. This concentrates the emitted light into a narrow, parallel beam to ensure the light reaching the detector is not diffuse. A tight, focused beam is crucial for the precise detection of small objects or fine positioning as it provides a high-contrast change when interrupted.

The detector is a high-performance integrated circuit containing several components on a single chip. The photodiode is the primary sensing element, and is responsible for converting the incident infrared light into an electrical current through the photoelectric effect. The minuscule current generated by the photodiode is fed into a highly sensitive amplifier. This amplifies the signal to a level that can be reliably processed by the subsequent digital circuitry. The core of the signal processing is a built-in Schmitt trigger circuit. Unlike a simple phototransistor that provides a proportional analog current, the Schmitt trigger provides hysteresis. It has two distinct switching thresholds. The output switches ON only when the input light intensity surpasses a higher "turn-ON" threshold, and switches OFF only when it drops below a lower "turn-OFF" threshold. This hysteresis prevents the output from oscillating when the light level is near the switching point. This is critical for reliable detection, especially when an object moves slowly through the beam or when there is slight vibration. The output of the Schmitt trigger drives a final output stage, which provides the digital output signal. As an object enters the sensor's slot, it breaks the focused infrared light beam, causing the photodiode's output current to drop sharply. This causes the Schmitt trigger to cross its lower threshold and switch the output state. When the object exits, the light beam is restored, and the trigger crosses its upper threshold, reverting the output.
